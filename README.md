### Project Title: Unveiling Insights in Credit Card Customer Dynamics

#### Project Overview:

This data analysis project revolves around the "Credit Card customers" dataset, aiming to uncover patterns and insights related to customer behavior and financial attributes. The analysis uses SQL for data processing and Tableau for visualization, presenting an in-depth exploration of credit card holders.

#### SQL Data Analysis Questions:

**1. Average Age of Customers:**
   - Explanation: Calculating the average age of customers provides a baseline understanding of the age distribution within the dataset. This demographic insight can be valuable for targeted marketing and product offerings.

**2. Average Credit Limit for Customers in Each Income Category:**
   - Explanation: By grouping customers based on income categories and calculating the average credit limit for each group, the analysis helps discern the relationship between income levels and credit limits. This is crucial for assessing creditworthiness and tailoring financial products.

**3. Correlation between Total Relationship Count and Months of Inactivity:**
   - Explanation: Understanding the correlation between the total relationship count and months of inactivity sheds light on customer engagement. A positive correlation may indicate that more active customers maintain stronger relationships.

**4. Correlation between Total Transaction Amount and Number of Transactions:**
   - Explanation: Investigating the correlation between total transaction amount and the number of transactions for each customer reveals insights into spending habits. It can indicate whether customers with more transactions tend to spend more or less per transaction.

**5. Average Utilization Ratio Based on Card Category and Customer Age:**
   - Explanation: Analyzing the average utilization ratio based on card category and customer age provides a nuanced perspective on how customers of different ages utilize credit cards. This insight can guide marketing strategies and product design.

#### Tableau Sheet Ideas:

**1. Average Credit Utilization Based on Customer Age:**
   - Explanation: A Tableau sheet could display a scatter plot or line chart depicting the average credit utilization ratio against customer age. This visual representation helps identify trends or clusters in credit utilization patterns across different age groups.

**2. Credit Limit Based on Marital Status:**
   - Explanation: Another Tableau sheet could present a bar chart illustrating the average credit limits for customers based on marital status. This visualization helps assess whether marital status influences credit limit assignments.

#### Conclusion:

Combining SQL data analysis with Tableau visualizations provides a comprehensive exploration of credit card customer dynamics. The insights gained from this project can inform strategic decisions related to marketing, customer engagement, and financial product development.
